Data security

## MongoDB

MongoDB is a document database that works with an access port. It is important to secure this port to external servers to prevent people from getting direct access to mongoDB data.

Saving MongoDB data is simple and must be done. The mongoDB data files can be easily copied to make a backup, and restored by a simple copy, provided that the mongoDB service has been stopped first.

## Relational database

Saving the database is also critical and has to be done with the tools supplied by the database providers.
