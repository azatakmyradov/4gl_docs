Curr

`Curr` is used as a [Read](4gl_read.html) or [Update](4gl_update.html) option to define the fact that the current record is considered.

# Syntax

```
Read [ABV]KEY Curr
Readlock [ABV]KEY Curr
Look [ABV]KEY Curr
Update [ABV]KEY Curr
Delete [ABV]KEY Curr
```

* `ABV` is optional and gives the abbreviation of the table.
* `KEY` is the key identifier. It can be given, but in this case it is useless.
