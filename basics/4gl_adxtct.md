`adxtct` is a [Char](4gl_char.html) variable that indicates the name of the table where the sequence numbers are stored.

# Syntax

```
adxtct
```

The Sage X3 engine manages a dedicated variable class called [C]. Elements defined in this class are shared values between all Sage X3 processes accessing the same folder. Technically, they are managed in a database table. The variable `adxtct` returns the name of this table (APLCOM).
